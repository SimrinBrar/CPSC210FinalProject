# CPSC 210 Project
## Movie Tracker App

For my personal project, I plan to make a **movie tracker app.** This app will be helpful for people who want to keep a 
list of their favourite movies, as well as keep leave ratings on each movie on a scale of one to five stars. 
Some user stories to describe this app include:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a movie to a list of movies I have seen
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of movies titles I have seen
- As a user, I want to be able to select a movie and view the year it was released
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to select a movie and rate it on a scale of 5 stars
